# Euler Path

- It is a path in a graph that visits **every edge** exactly once. Vertex ke baare mai sochna hi nahi hai.
- Euler path may _not_ exist for every graph.
- Existence of euler path depends on choice of starting node of path.
- Bina pen uthaye pura drawing/graph banane wala concept hai bas.

## Condition for Euler Circuit

- Every node should have even degree.

# Euler Cycle / Circuit

- Same as euler path, visit every edge exactly once but the starting point must be same as ending point.
- If euler circuit exists, you can start and end at any same node, full flexibility milegi.
